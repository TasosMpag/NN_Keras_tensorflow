This repository explores neural network architectures using the Fashion MNIST dataset, focusing on feature selection and overfitting mitigation strategies. The first part investigates how different feature subsets (upper and lower portions of images) impact classification performance. It involves preprocessing, visualization, and training two neural network models using Keras and TensorFlow. Performance differences are analyzed through classification reports and misclassification patterns. The second part examines overfitting reduction techniques by training a deeper network with early stopping, batch normalization, and dropout layers. The effects of these techniques are evaluated through performance metrics and learning curves, highlighting their impact on model generalization.
